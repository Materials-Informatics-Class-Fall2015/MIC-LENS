## Work in Progress ##

We are eagerly awaiting the PCA results of the entire 1799 microstructure ensemble. The job requires over 64GB of memory to run with a rough estimate of ~90GB. Currently the job is pending in the PACE queue waiting for the resources to become available.

Meanwhile work is continued on CLD algorithm. The idea is to supplement the CLD PCA with 2pt statistics PCA where one fails. The Class 2 data can only be meaningfully modeled using 2pt statistics PCA while both can be used for Class 1 data.
