Intro/Bacground
---------------
The LENS additive manufacturing process creates fully-dense alloy components with process parameter-dependent microstructure. In this project we investigate the morphology of the microstructure crystal grains and it's dependence on process parameters using a Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) approach. A simulated dataset shared with us through Harvard's Dataverse was subjected to the MKS approach. The dataset's creator Theron Rogers of Sandia National Labs has been our collaborator and domain expert, guiding the direction of the project. More detail can be found [here](http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-LENS/2015/09/24/Intro_LENS/).

Motivation:
-----------
The project is an effort to understand LENS fabricated materials as a function of LENS process parameters. The LENS process creates metal/alloy deposits with a tightly controlled chemistry but the microstructure also plays a large part in the material's mechanical properties. The Process-Structure link we create is the first step to 

With the extracted Process-Structure linkages this work will pave the way for deep uderstanding of LENS microstructure control but also make suggestions towards LENS-simulations and LENS-systems developments.  



The grand vision of MKS is to create material engineering and discovery techniques 

create linkages between material Process Structure and Properties, . In this project process-structure linkages are sought using MKS


 

Objective:
----------
how, data

The objective of this project was to extract process-structure linkages from the simulated dataset. The grain size- and shape-distribution was specified as an important structure metric. The general direction of the project became extraction of grain evolution patterns with respect to simulation process parameters. The 

Approach/Workflow:
------------------
The dataset represents 1799 unique 3D digital microstructures created by SPPARKS monte carlo simulations. Each structure occupies a 300x300x200 unit volume and is associated with a unique set of processing parameters listed below:

(X/XY)Scan Pattern	Linear and layer-by-layer cross-hatch
(W)Melt spot width (lattice sites)	60, 70, 80, 90
(V)Velocity (sites/timestep)	2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15
(D)Melt spot depth (sites)	 50, 75
(L)Melt spot tail length (sites)	50, 60, 70, 80
(HAZ)Heat-affected-zone width (sites)	10, 20, 36
(T)Heat-affected-zone tail length (sites)	5, 20, 35
