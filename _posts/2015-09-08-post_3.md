Process-Microstructure Relationships in Polyethylene Under Uniaxial Strain
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Team Members
------------

Andriy Dotsenko
Xinyi Gong

Project Goals
-------------

 - Find process-structure evolution linkages in polyetylene under appied uniaxial strain using Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) data.
 - Find correlations between WAXS and linkages found in [previous work](http://phelpsforpresident.github.io/MIC-XRD-Polymer/about/) using the Small Angle X-ray ScatteringSAXS data.

Process: Applied strain and strain rate
Structure: Captured by XRD images at different length scales

Background
