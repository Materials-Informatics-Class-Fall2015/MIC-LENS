  bio: Andriy Dotsenko is a Ph.D. student in the school of Mechanical Engineering, working with Dr. Suman Das in the Direct Digital Manufacturing Lab (DDML). He has a B.S. in Physics from Stony Brook University and industry experience working at HYPRES, inc. in the area of superconducting electronics. His current research is metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) at the intersection of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science with the goal of developing a light-weight, high-strength aluminum alloy optimized for AM. A general Combinatorial High Throughput (CHT) alloy synthesis technique for alloy development and discovery is developed as a tool to realize this goal, and can be extended to other alloy systems.
